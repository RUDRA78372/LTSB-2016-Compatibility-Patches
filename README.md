# LTSB-2016-Compatibility-Patches
A lot of programs written for current versions of Windows 10 don't work on the older LTSB versions.

I myself use the older version because I have a cheap laptop and newer versions of windows are slower for me.

In this repo, I will be uploading tutorials and patches to run newer programs on Windows 10 1607 LTSB. 

Help is appreciated.
